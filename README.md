- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

4. Set up the database:

npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

5. (Optional) Seed the database with an admin user:
```bash
# You can create an admin user manually through the database or API
```

- Subscription, Payment
- JobPost, Application
- ContractOffer, Contact
- Advertisement, ActivityLog

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate Prisma Client
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema to database
- `npm run db:migrate` - Run database migrations
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio

### Creating an Admin User

## Deployment

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (e.g., Supabase, Railway, or your own server)
